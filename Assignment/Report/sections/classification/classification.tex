Supervised Classigication involves training a supervised model based on the
aforementioned features, using a validation set. Due to an error which was
occurring - values within the target set changing to ``NaN'' - the chosen
cross validation method of ``Leave One Out'' cross validation could not be
correctly implemented, however, the tested implementation is commented within
the code. As such, only the held-out test set could be used for the purpose of
validation.

\par The ``Pipeline'' function is used to quickly create a model, allowing for
the vectorizer, tfidf function, and classifier to be applied to the training
sets for the features and targets. The models are saved using the ``pickle''
library's ``dump'' function. Each optimised model is saved after fitting.
