\subsection{Feature Extraction}

For the purposes of feature extraction, a ``Bag of Words'' tokenizer is utilised
to count the occurrences of words within the headlines. The sklearn
``CountVectorizer'' function provides this functionality\cite{skcntVect}. There are a number of
tunable parameters with this function, however, the main concern for this
assignment is the inclusion or removal of ``stop words''. The headlines, and the
words of which they comprise are the features within this dataset.

\par TFIDF stands for Term-Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency. Term Frequency
is given in terms of each headline, i.e. how frequent a term is within the
headline, whereas inverse document frequency is the number of occurrences of the
word acrross all documents. Tf-Idf can be implemented in python using the
sklearn ``TfidfTransformer'' method, which can be configured to utilise, or
ignore, idf. A comparison of the inclusion or exclusion of idf is contained in
the Model Selection section.
