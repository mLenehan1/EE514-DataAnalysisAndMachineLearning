While there were a number of requirements not completely satisfied within this
assignment, there are a number of conclusions which can be drawn.

\par In general the Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier model achieved much
greater accuracy than the Stochastic Gradient Descent model. With an approximate
difference of 4\% in the accuracies achieved. The difference achieved could have
been much greater, had a correct implementation of Leave One Out Cross
Validation been utilised.

\par The evaluation of the models showed the differences in precision and
recall for the ``best case'' models, and the confusion matrices provided show
the number of false positives and false negatives for each model.

\par Overall, the Naive Bayes Classifier model achieved better overall accuracy
due to it's higher recall for ``real'' articles, and higher precision for
``fake'' articles. These attributes allowed for the much lower false positives,
and relatively low false negatives.
